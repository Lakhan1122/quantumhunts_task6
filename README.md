# Merged Video Player Webpage

This project demonstrates how to create a webpage with a merged video player using Video.js. The merged video player plays two MP4 video files sequentially, similar to how YouTube ads play multiple videos in a sequence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and web development tools.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have the MP4 video files (`file1.mp4` and `file2.mp4`) ready.
3. Place the video files in the same directory as the `index.html` and `script.js` files.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. The merged video player will automatically load and start playing `file1.mp4`.
3. Once `file1.mp4` ends, the player will automatically transition to playing `file2.mp4`.
4. The sequence will loop back to `file1.mp4` after `file2.mp4` ends.

## Customization

You can customize this project by:

- Replacing `file1.mp4` and `file2.mp4` with your own MP4 video files.
- Modifying the HTML and CSS to match your preferred design and layout.
- Adding additional videos to the `videoSources` array in the `script.js` file.
